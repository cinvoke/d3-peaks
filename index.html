In this article, I explain how the 
<a href="https://github.com/efekarakus/d3-peaks" target="_blank">d3-peaks</a>
plugin works. The plugin is based on the work of Du, Pan, Warren A. Kibbe, and Simon M. Lin. 
<a href="https://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/17/2059.full" target="_blank">
"Improved peak detection in mass spectrum by incorporating continuous wavelet transform-based pattern matching."</a>
Bioinformatics 22.17 (2006): 2059-2065.

</p>
The goal of this article is not to only explain how the algorithm works. 
But, hopefully achieve a higher goal and show that with examples and 
explanations we can make complex research papers a lot more readable, 
and hence reach a broader audience.

Problem
</h2>

<p>
Imagine we are given the heart rates of an individual while exercising. 
We want to find out when are the periods of rest and activity. 
By finding <span class="highlight">relevant</span> peaks in the dataset,
we can discern the underlying region beneath it and label the regions accordingly.
